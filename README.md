#FEMA National Risk Index Scores by State
### eds240-nri-acs-viz

This repository contains all code and outputs for the second homework assignment for EDS240 - Data Visualization & Communication for the UCSB MEDS program. This project focuses on exploring the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
Resilience Analysis and Planning Tool (RAPT) data to compare California county National Risk Index (NRI) scores to other contiguous U.S. states.

## Data
In this project, we work with data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Resilience Analysis and Planning Tool (RAPT). This tool has more than 100 layers of social data like population, infrastructure and hazards. We work with the National Risk Index (NRI) which provides information about which communities are at risk to 18 different natural hazards. Each community is assigned a risk rating based on annual expected loss, social vulnerability, and community resilience. These risk ratings are represented by percentile ranking among all communities at the same risk level.
